# ArecaSafe

ArecaSafe is an intelligent system designed for early prediction and detection of arecanut crop diseases using environmental data and image-based analysis.

---

## Overview
The project combines IoT-based data acquisition, machine learning models, and a mobile application interface to analyze disease risk conditions and support early preventive decision-making.

This repository contains the **core implementation components** of the system for reference and evaluation purposes.
